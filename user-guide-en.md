# Pixel Art Generator User Guide

## Features

### Animation Types

- Available animation types: Wave, Ripple, Stripes, Dots, Vortex, Pulse, Checkerboard, and Pixel Wave.

### Pixel Size

- Adjust the size of individual pixels in your art.
- Use the slider to change the pixel size from 20px to 60px.

### Color Variance

- Control the degree of color variation in your pixel art.
- Higher values create more dramatic color changes, while lower values result in more subtle variations.

### Primary and Secondary Colors

For both primary and secondary colors:
1. Use the color picker to select a base color.
2. Fine-tune the color using individual Red, Green, and Blue sliders.
3. The selected color is displayed in a preview box.
4. Click the "Copy" button to copy the color's hex code to your clipboard.

### Animation Controls

- Click the "Pause Animation" button to stop the animation.
- Click "Resume Animation" to restart the animation.

### Save and Load

- Use the "Save State" button to save your current settings and canvas state.
- Click "Load State" to restore a previously saved configuration.

## Important Notes

- Due to the dynamic nature of the animations, the current state is saved as a JSON file rather than an image.
- For consistency, even when the animation is paused, the state is saved as JSON.
- If there's a need to save static images in the future, we will implement this feature by disabling the animation effect at the code level.

Enjoy creating with the Pixel Art Generator!
